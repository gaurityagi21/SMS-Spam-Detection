# SMS Spam Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam). Three different models were trained and evaluated: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Naive Bayes model was found to perform the best and is used in the final implementation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 5,572 SMS messages labeled as 'ham' (non-spam) or 'spam'.

## Usage

1. **Download the dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
2. **Upload the dataset** to your working directory.
3. **Preprocess the data** by removing unnecessary columns and converting labels to binary.
4. **Train the models** (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM) using machine learning techniques.
5. **Evaluate the models' performance** using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Save the best model** and necessary preprocessing artifacts (e.g., TF-IDF vectorizer) for future use.

## installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
